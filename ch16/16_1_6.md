### 16.1.6 Difference between `shared_ptr` and `unique_ptr`
```C++
// unique_ptr
template<
    class T,
    class Deleter = std::default_delete<T>
> class unique_ptr;

// shared_ptr
template< class T > class shared_ptr;
```
The deleter type is part of the type of `unique_ptr` that must be specified at declaration. `shared_ptr` stores the deleter as a member 

1. Recompilation cost. 
    `shared_ptr` storing deleter as a member function means that the deleter type is not part of the type of the `shared_ptr`. Thus, if your change the type of the deleter of a `shared_ptr`, you do not need to recompile the program.
    
2. more flexibility
3. overhead
